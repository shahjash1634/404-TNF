## 📝Description
Not knowing the syllabus, the required study material till the previous week of the exam is the most common problem that all the students face. This not only affects the students academic performance but as well affects his/her stress conditions. For which we propose an intellectual platform which provides a student teacher connect interface, predominantly the overview of each day’s work done in the class. This app aims to provide a student-teacher friendly solution to improve students academics , ease the professors, and make learning and teaching better.
1. Attendance: Teacher can take attendance directly from the app and has no need to keep a record of students attendance,also a student can keep track of its attendance and manage college accordingly.
2. Chat: A chat interface between students and teacher so teacher can easily give updates to student and keep all academically important documents at one single place. 
3. Announcements: Announcemts feature where teacher can assign announcemnts for students.
